Problems Solved:
- Leetcode 347. Top K Frequent Elements

Topics:
- Hash Map
- Bucket Sort
- Heap

Notes:
- Used two approaches - sorting approach and bucket array approach
- Both use a hash map to count frequencies first
- Sorting approach has O(N log N) time complexity
- Bucket array approach has O(N) time complexity
